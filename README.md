# Teacher Class Scheduler: Vue.js and PostgreSQL Conversion

## Overview

This project has been converted from a client-side only application using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript to a full-stack application with:

- **Vue.js frontend**: Modern component-based UI
- **Express backend**: RESTful API server
- **PostgreSQL database**: Robust data persistence
- **Docker support**: Containerized development environment

The application has been restructured to better utilize horizontal space with a 2-column layout that improves the user experience on larger screens.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Enhanced Architecture

- **Client-Server Separation**: Clear separation of concerns between UI (Vue) and data management (Express + PostgreSQL)
- **State Management**: Vuex store modules for organized state handling
- **API Services**: Dedicated service layers for communication between frontend and backend
- **Component-Based Design**: Modular Vue components that are easier to maintain and extend

### 2. Optimized UI Layout

- **Two-Column Design**: Left column for management panels (classes, textbooks, etc.) and right column for schedule views
- **Tabbed Interface**: Easily switch between templates, weekly schedule, and daily schedule views
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes while prioritizing horizontal space usage
- **Modal Dialogs**: Improved editing experience with dedicated editing interfaces

### 3. Robust Data Persistence

- **PostgreSQL Database**: Replaced localStorage with proper database tables and relationships
- **Data Validation**: Server-side validation ensures data integrity
- **Transaction Support**: Complex operations (like template application) use database transactions for consistency
- **Indexing**: Optimized query performance with appropriate database indexes

### 4. Additional Features

- **User Authentication**: Multi-user support with secure authentication
- **Improved Data Relationships**: Proper foreign keys and constraints between related data
- **Better Exception Handling**: More robust error handling throughout the application

## Technical Highlights

### Frontend (Vue.js)

- **Component Structure**: Organized components for each major feature
- **Vuex Store**: Modular store design with separate modules for each data type
- **API Integration**: Clean service layer for API communication
- **Form Handling**: Improved form components with validation

### Backend (Express + PostgreSQL)

- **API Routes**: RESTful API endpoints for all application features
- **Database Schema**: Well-structured tables with proper relationships
- **Middleware**: Authentication and error handling middleware
- **Transaction Support**: Database transactions for data consistency

### Development Environment

- **Docker Compose**: Easy setup with containerized services
- **Development Scripts**: Convenient npm scripts for common tasks
- **Environment Configuration**: Flexible configuration via environment variables

## Result

The converted application maintains all the functionality of the original while adding:
1. Better organization and structure
2. Improved horizontal space utilization
3. Proper data persistence
4. Multi-user support
5. Enhanced maintainability and extensibility

This modern architecture makes the application more scalable, maintainable, and provides a better foundation for future enhancements.
