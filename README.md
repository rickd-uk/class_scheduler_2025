* **üìö Resource Management**: Easily add, edit, and delete Classes, Textbooks, and School Year details.
* **üìÑ Template System**: Create, apply, and manage reusable schedule templates (e.g., "Standard Week", "Exam Week").
* **üö´ Days Off & Exceptions**: Mark specific days off (holidays, personal days) and handle daily schedule exceptions or modifications.
* **üîê User Authentication**: Secure login and registration for multi-user support.
* **‚ú® Modern UI**: Responsive design built with Vue 3 and the Composition API.
